React hook for managing effectful reducers.

## Motivation

When your application gets bigger, it is hard to manage both state
changes and effectful computations. I find the Model-View-Update
pattern (which the [Elm
architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) is based on)
really effective for this kind of task. `useBireducer` implements this
pattern by combining two reducers (hence the name): a state reducer
and an effect reducer.

The state reducer is really close to `useReducer`, except that it
returns the new state AND the effects to execute:

```typescript
type StateReducer<S, A, E> = (state: S, action: A) => [S, Array<E>];
```

The effect reducer just executes effects and can return a cleanup
function. This cleanup function is called when the component unmounts:

```typescript
type EffectReducer<E, A> = (effect: E, dispatch: React.Dispatch<A>) => void | (() => void);
```

This pattern helps you to separate state changes from effectful
computations. It also makes your tests stronger.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add react-use-bireducer
# or
npm install react-use-bireducer
```

## Usage

```typescript
import {useBireducer} from "react-use-bireducer";

const [state, dispatch] = useBireducer(stateReducer, effectReducer, defaultState);
```

See a complete example on
[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-use-bireducer-example-20n30w?file=/src/App.tsx).

If you want to see an example in a real world application, have a look
at
[react-pin-field](https://github.com/soywod/react-pin-field/blob/49418994ae39c3aac67d2b4f94082a20effcea4b/lib/src/pin-field/pin-field.tsx#L251).

## Development

Development environment is managed by [Nix](https://nixos.org/). First
you need to install it:

```bash
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
```

Then you can start your development environment by spawning a Nix
shell:

```bash
nix-shell
```

Now you should be able to clone the repo and install Node.js
dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soywod/react-use-bireducer.git
cd react-use-bireducer
yarn
```

You can leave the development environment either by killing your
terminal or by entering the command `exit`.

## Tests

Tests are handled by [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) (`.test` files) and
[React Testing
Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
(`.spec` files).

```bash
yarn test
```

- [`useEffectReducer`](https://github.com/davidkpiano/useEffectReducer):
  the state reducer exposes a third argument called `exec` to schedule
  effects
- [`useElmish`](https://github.com/ncthbrt/react-use-elmish): it is a
  mix between `useEffectReducer` and `useBireducer`
